Q1) Using the graph view of the decision tree model, what is the first predictive independent variable in the tree?

Comprehensive Claims
Late Payments
At Fault Accidents
Moving Violations

Q2) Using the graph view of the decision tree model, if a person had one or more at fault accident and was over age 65, what Insurance Category would the model predict?

No prediction would be made for this new applicant
High Risk-Do Not Insure
Low Risk
Moderate Risk

Q3) Using the graph view of the decision tree model, what Insurance Category would the model predict for a 47-year-old man with no comprehensive claims, no late payments, no at fault accidents, and only one claim on his policy overall?

Low Risk
No prediction would be made for this new applicant
High Risk-Do Not Insure
Moderate Risk

Q4) Using the graph view of the decision tree model, if a 55-year-old woman had two at fault accidents, several moving violations, and three comprehensive claims, which attribute would the decision tree use to determine if this woman will be predicted as Potentially High Risk or High Risk-Do Not Insure?

Late Payments
At Fault Accidents
Payment Method
Gender
