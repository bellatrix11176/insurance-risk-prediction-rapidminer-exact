# Insurance Risk Prediction — RapidMiner Exact

This project reproduces a RapidMiner decision tree **exactly** using Python by parsing the exported RapidMiner tree text and computing predictions and confidence values directly from each leaf’s class distribution.

The goal is validation and interpretability: demonstrating that a visually designed model can be translated into deterministic, auditable logic **without changing its behavior**.

Running this project produces a scored output file for new applicants using the exact RapidMiner decision logic.

## What This Project Does

- Reads an insurance dataset from `data/InsuranceData.xlsx`
- Loads the RapidMiner decision tree export from `rapidminer/rapidminer_tree_exports.txt`
- Converts each root-to-leaf path into explicit rules
- Scores every record in the **New Applicants** sheet by following the same decision paths RapidMiner uses
- Writes a scored CSV output containing predictions and confidence values

## What “RapidMiner Exact” Means

This implementation does **not** train a new decision tree.

Instead, it treats the RapidMiner tree export as the **source of truth** and:

- parses the exported RapidMiner decision tree text,
- converts each root-to-leaf path into ordered rules,
- computes confidence values using RapidMiner’s leaf class counts:
