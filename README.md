## Insurance Data Analysis (RapidMiner)

This repository contains a course assignment focused on analyzing insurance data using
RapidMiner, followed by a parallel implementation in Python to reproduce and validate
the same analytical steps programmatically.

The project was structured around a series of assignment questions (Q1–Q10), each
requiring specific data preparation, exploration, and decision tree logic. RapidMiner
was used to visually design and execute the full analytical workflow, including data
cleaning, attribute selection, and decision tree generation.

To demonstrate conceptual understanding beyond the visual tool, the same operations
were then replicated in Python. This included implementing decision logic manually and
generating equivalent outputs to confirm correctness of results produced in RapidMiner.

Supporting files include:
- RapidMiner-generated decision tree outputs (PNG)
- A text-based menu tree exported from RapidMiner (.txt)
- Assignment-aligned artifacts corresponding to questions Q1–Q10

This repository emphasizes process, validation, and learning outcomes rather than
production-ready optimization.
