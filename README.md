Project Overview

The project analyzes an insurance dataset through a series of structured assignment questions (Q1–Q10), each requiring specific data preparation, exploration, and decision tree logic. RapidMiner was used to visually design and execute the full analytical workflow, including data cleaning, attribute selection, and decision tree generation.

To demonstrate conceptual understanding beyond the visual analytics tool, the same analytical steps were replicated in Python. This included manually implementing decision logic and generating equivalent outputs to validate the results produced in RapidMiner.

Tools & Methods
RapidMiner Studio (visual workflow design and modeling)
Python (programmatic replication and validation)
Excel (data source)

Repository Contents
RapidMiner-generated decision tree outputs (PNG)
Text-based menu tree exported from RapidMiner (.txt)
Assignment-aligned artifacts corresponding to questions Q1–Q10
Python scripts reproducing the RapidMiner logic

Focus & Scope
This project emphasizes process, validation, and learning outcomes rather than production-level optimization. The goal is to demonstrate understanding of data preparation, decision tree logic, and cross-tool translation between visual analytics and code-based implementations.
